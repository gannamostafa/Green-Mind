# 🌿 Green Mind

**Green Mind** is an interactive educational platform designed to inspire children to love nature and learn about the environment in a fun, playful, and meaningful way.
The website combines games, rewards, environmental lessons, and AI-powered plant recognition to make eco-education engaging and accessible for kids.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The main goal of **Green Mind** is to teach kids eco-friendly habits—such as recycling, planting, and saving resources—using interactive games and activities.
Children earn points and rewards as they progress, allowing them to grow a **virtual tree** that evolves with every achievement.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Parents** create an account using Firebase Authentication.
2. They add one or more **child profiles** stored in Firestore.
3. **Children** start playing educational games and earn points.
4. Points help grow the **virtual tree** and unlock new lessons.
5. Children upload plant images → stored in Firebase Storage.
6. Firebase Cloud Functions send the image URL to the **Python AI API**.
7. The AI returns plant info → saved in Firestore → displayed to the child.
8. **Parents** monitor progress through their dashboard.
